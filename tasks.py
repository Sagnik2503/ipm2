#     Framework for Analysis:
#     1. Strategic Risks:
#        - Misalignment with business goals.
#        - Scope creep or changing stakeholder priorities.
  
#   2. Technical Risks:
#        - API reliability or third-party service dependency (e.g., Stripe, Twilio).

#        - Changes to external regulations (e.g., GDPR, WCAG).

#     6. Assumptions & Constraints Validation:
#        - Identify risks tied to assumptions that could break.
#        - Reevaluate the impact of stated constraints.

#     7. Time and Budget Risks:
#        - Assess potential time delays in the project schedule and their cascading impact on deliverables.
#        - Evaluate risks related to exceeding the allocated project budget and implications for resource planning.

#     Evaluation Criteria:

#         - Scalability, uptime, and cloud-native system reliability

#         3. Operational Risks
#         - Procurement delays for key tools (e.g., Figma, Datadog)
#         - Gaps in team skillsets or availability across cross-functional squads
#         - QA bottlenecks or compliance hold-ups
